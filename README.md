# cloudmetrics-c3ontext
Attempt to marry [cloudmetrics](https://github.com/cloudsci/cloudmetrics), a package to compute metrics of the organisation of 2D cloud fields, to [C3ONTEXT](https://github.com/observingClouds/C3ONTEXT), a data set of satellite-observed cloud scenes and their human classification into pattern classes.
The code is under development, and currently consists of:
- A notebook of early analysis by Marion DuguÃ© (`marion.ipynb`)
- Martin's reinterpretation of that notebook (`cloudmetrics-goes16-IR.ipynb`), which currently loops over the files underlying C3ONTEXT, computes the metrics listed below for each scene and stores them in a `pandas DataFrame`, `df_metrics`:
```
metrics = ['cloud_fraction',
           'fractal_dimension',
           'open_sky',
           'cop',
           'iorg',
           'scai',
           'max_length_scale',
           'mean_eccentricity',
           'mean_length_scale',
           'mean_perimeter_length',
           'num_objects',
           'orientation',
           'spectral_length_moment',
           'spectral_anisotropy',
           'spectral_slope',
           'woi1',
           'woi2',
           'woi3'
          ]
```
- A comparison to the level-3, 'instant'-sampled, manually classified IR images in `C3ONTEXT` (`level3_IR_instant`), in an attempt to reproduce fig. 6 from [Schulz (2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1233-2022) (`compare-C3ONTEXT.ipynb`).

> **NOTE**: The level-3 c3ontext data should be accessible through the `eurec4a` catalag, but I am currently unable to make that work, and so have downloaded the data myself from https://zenodo.org/record/5979718#.Yrxu2hNBztM
